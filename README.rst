String Similarity Metric
========================

This is a simple implementation of a string similarity metric based on Jaro-Distance. Note that I have not published this, so manual download is neccessary. 

Usage
=====
::

    var stringsim = require('./stringsim')
    console.log(stringsim.compare("string1","string2"))
